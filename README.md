# PumpWatchdog Multi-Timeframe Scanner

PumpWatchdog is an automated crypto market scanner that continuously monitors the **top 100 USDT trading pairs by volume on KuCoin**. It calculates multiple technical indicators and ranks coins based on their pump potential, displaying the results in a live-updating terminal table. The tool is ideal for active traders seeking early momentum opportunities or tracking market activity across a wide range of assets.

## Features

- **Live Automated Scanning:** Monitors the top 100 USDT pairs on KuCoin, updating every 60 seconds.
- **Technical Indicators:** Computes technical signals like ADX, CCI, Williams %R, ROC, RSI, and more (customizable via `indicators.py`).
- **Pump Scoring:** Assigns each coin a score and status (HOT, Pump, Watch, Weak) based on live indicator triggers.
- **Age Tracking:** Shows how many times each symbol has appeared on the chart since the script started.
- **Ranked Output:** Prints a ranked, readable table in the terminal and logs all results to CSV.
- **Easy Extensibility:** Modular designâ€”add or adjust indicators via the `indicators.py` file.
- **KuCoin Native:** All data and symbols are pulled live from KuCoin, ensuring compatibility and up-to-date listings.

## Usage

Start the scanner with:

```sh
python main.py
```

The script will:

- Fetch the top 100 USDT pairs by volume from KuCoin every 60 seconds.
- Calculate technical indicators for each symbol.
- Print a ranked table showing:
  - Rank
  - Symbol
  - Pump Score
  - Status (HOT, Pump, Watch, Weak)
  - Confidence %
  - PumpTime
  - Age (number of times the coin has appeared on the chart since script start)
  - Number of triggers and trigger details
- Log all results to `pumpwatchdog_log.csv` for later analysis.

---

## Customization

- **Indicators & Scoring:**  
  Edit `indicators.py` to adjust which indicators are used or how scores are calculated.
- **Number of Pairs:**  
  To scan more or fewer pairs, change the `n=100` value in `get_top_usdt_pairs()` in `main.py`.
- **Exchange:**  
  By default, the script scans KuCoin. To use another exchange supported by [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt), change the `exchange_name` argument in `main.py`.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing modules, run `pip install` as above.
- If the script cannot fetch dynamic pairs (for example, if KuCoin is down), it falls back to a small static list.
- If your terminal or editor shows warnings about style schemes, you can ignore themâ€”they don't affect scanning.
